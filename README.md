modemaus
========

Modemaus is a JavaScript web app that lets you see where all the hotspots are on the guitar fretboard in each modal scale - Learn guitar modes, scales, and chords visually.

In Progress
===========
Currently abstracting out all of the objects, prepping the program to be moved into a Node.js/Express build where scales will be built on the backend, and will be deep-linkable.
